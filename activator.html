<h1 class="nav">what is KMS</h1>

<p>Key Management Service (KMS) is a technology used by Microsoft Windows to activate Windows and other Microsoft products within a network environment. KMS allows organizations to activate multiple computers using a single activation key, instead of requiring individual keys for each computer.

    <P>Here's how KMS works:</P>
    </p>
   <img src="images/home/how to install windows 10/kms.png">
    <ol>
        <li>A KMS host server is set up on a network. The host server must have a valid KMS host key from Microsoft, which is used to activate the server.</li>
        <li>Client computers on the network are configured to use the KMS activation method. The client computers will periodically check in with the KMS host server to renew their activation status.</li>
        <li>When a client computer requests activation, the KMS host server verifies that the request is coming from an authorized computer on the network.</li>
        <li>If the request is valid, the KMS host server activates the client computer by assigning it an activation ID. The activation ID is used to activate the Windows installation on the client computer.</li>
        <li>Once activated, the client computer will periodically check in with the KMS host server to renew its activation status.</li>
      </ol>
  <p>KMS is a more efficient and centralized way to activate Windows installations in a network environment, as it eliminates the need for individual activation keys for each computer. It also provides a level of security by ensuring that only authorized computers can activate Windows installations on the network.</p>
